# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
This app was inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's Pathfinding Visualizer: https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/#

I thought he made a pretty cool thing, so I used it as a programming challenge for myself. I did it to both to learn Next.js and to practice implementing existing programming algorithms.

My version uses Next.js with typescript, Recoil state management, and tailwindcss.

# Run
